# Nominators | Stake to Earn $AI3

Any $AI3 token holder can nominate ([stake](../../autonomys-network/decoupled-execution/staking.md) $AI3) to their preferred [operator](../spaceacres-cli/operators.md)'s nomination pool in exchange for a share of the [transaction fees](../../autonomys-network/rewards-and-fees/) that operator earns. Nominators increase the operator's total stake and therefore their chance of producing a [transaction bundle](../../autonomys-network/decoupled-execution/domains/) and earning fees, but also share in any slashing risks. This creates a symbiotic relationship between operators and nominators that incentivizes optimal performance and enhances network security and efficiency.
