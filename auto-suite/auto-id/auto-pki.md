# Auto PKI

**Auto PKI** is a framework for creating and deploying unique consortium-based instances of the Auto ID registry for industry or application-specific use cases.

Consortium-based identity systems are designed to facilitate secure and trusted digital interactions between a group of organizations or entities within a specific industry or domain. These systems establish a shared framework for managing digital identities, enabling participating members to authenticate and authorize individuals or entities within the consortium.

Examples of consortium-based identity systems include the banking industry's efforts to establish a shared know-your-customer (KYC) platform, and the shipping industry's initiatives to create a unified system for verifying the identities of vessels and their crew members.

In a consortium-based identity system built using Auto PKI, consortium members agree on policies and standards to govern the issuance, management and verification of the custom Auto IDs within their ecosystem, establishing a trusted environment where identities are recognized and accepted across the consortium.
