# Auto PKI

**Auto** [**PKI**](../../additional-learning/security-basics/public-key-infrastructure.md) is a framework for deploying unique instances of the Auto ID registry for application or industry specific use cases, such a or consortium based identity systems.

Consortium-based identity systems are designed to facilitate secure and trusted digital interactions among a group of organizations or entities within a specific industry or domain. These systems establish a shared framework for managing digital identities, enabling participating members to authenticate and authorize individuals or entities within the consortium. Examples of consortium-based identity systems include the banking industry's efforts to establish a shared know-your-customer (KYC) platform or the shipping industry's initiatives to create a unified system for verifying the identities of vessels and their crew members.

#### Introducing Auto PKI

Auto PKI is a framework that enables the creation of consortium-based identity systems tailored to specific applications or industry use cases. These systems leverage the capabilities of Auto ID to build trust within the consortium. Auto ID allows every participant, whether an AI or a human, to establish a verifiable digital identity online. It facilitates the authentication of content produced by these entities and grants authorization for AI systems to act on behalf of authorized individuals or organizations.

In a consortium built using Auto PKI, the participating members agree on policies and standards that govern the issuance, management, and verification of Auto ID digital identities within their ecosystem. This collaboration establishes a trusted environment where identities can be recognized and accepted across the consortium.
