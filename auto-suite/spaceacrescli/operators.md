# Operators | Compute to Earn $AI3

## Running an operator node

Anyone with a sufficiently powerful computer can pledge compute to the Autonomys Network in exchange for [$AI3 transaction fees](../../autonomys-network/rewards-and-fees/). Operator nodes validate and execute transactions on [decoupled execution (DecEx) domains](../../autonomys-network/decoupled-execution/) sharing the security of the [farmer](farmers.md)-maintained consensus chain. Operators (and [nominators](../astral/nominators-or-stake-to-earn-usdai3.md)) [stake](../../autonomys-network/decoupled-execution/staking.md) $AI3 to their node which is slashed if they are dishonest, providing crypto-economic security by disincentivizing bad actors. Fees incentivize operators to maintain high standards of reliability and efficiency in transaction processing as part of a self-sustaining ecosystem.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

To check the hardware requirements for running an operator node, and to get started via CLI, visit our [operator documentation](http://docs.autonomys.xyz/staking/operator/register).
