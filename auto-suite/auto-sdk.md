# Auto SDK

The [**Auto SDK**](http://develop.autonomys.xyz/sdk) is a powerful toolkit of JavaScript/TypeScript packages for developers to seamlessly integrate with the Autonomys Network. It provides simple APIs for interacting with the [_consensus_](../autonomys-network/consensus/) layer, utilizing [_data storage_](../autonomys-network/distributed-storage-network.md), managing [_decentralized identities_](auto-id/), and (soon) handling [_$AI3 payments_](../autonomys-network/rewards-and-fees/), in addition to general-purpose functions essential for building decentralized applications (dApps)—all in JavaScript and TypeScript—abstracting away the complexities of blockchain and smart contracts.

## Key features

* **Modular Architecture**: Use only the packages you need.
* **Easy to Use**: Simplifies blockchain operations with high-level functions.
* **Flexible**: Suitable for both beginners and experienced blockchain developers.
* **Open-source**: Built by and for the community.

## Why the Auto SDK?

* **Simplify Development**: Focus on your application’s logic rather than blockchain intricacies.
* **Accelerate Time-to-Market**: Reduce development time with ready-to-use functions.
* **Ensure Compatibility**: Stay up-to-date with the latest Autonomys blockchain protocols.
* **Enhance Security**: Utilize well-tested code for critical operations like identity management.
