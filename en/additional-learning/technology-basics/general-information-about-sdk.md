# General Information about SDK

## What is an SDK

An SDK, or Software Development Kit, is like a treasure chest for developers, packed with all the tools, code samples, and documentation needed to embark on the adventure of building apps. It's your all-in-one toolkit designed to streamline the creation process, whether you're developing sleek mobile apps, powerful software, or integrating cool features into existing platforms. Imagine having a magic wand that not only guides you through the forests of code but also empowers you to conjure up applications with ease, efficiency, and creativity. That's the power of an SDK in the hands of a developer: turning the complex journey of app development into a smooth and exciting quest for innovation.

### Components of SDK

While one SDK might be different from another, they all tend to have a similar structure.

* **Libraries and Frameworks**\
  When coding, there is a lot of repetitive code that every programmer does not want to write. At the same time, itâ€™s very important to not make a single mistake in some of the core functions, since your whole application depends on them! That is exactly why the set of the most commonly performed actions is wrapped in a reusable function and made available to everyone via the API call to the SDK. They save you from having to reinvent the wheel, allowing you to focus on unique features and delegate complex repetitive tasks to it.
* **Development Tools**\
  Anything from your code editor to your compiler is a development tool. They make every programmer's job more enjoyable and speed up the development process, turning it into a smooth and error-free journey.
* **Documentation**\
  Documentation is one of the key components of an SDK. You might have the best SDK in the world code-wise, filled with the most usable and important functions but there is no meaning to them if your documentation does not explain how to use it properly. Good documentation should be easy to navigate and to follow, so that every developer could be focused on building, rather than searching.
* **Code Samples and Tutorials**\
  One of the best ways to introduce an SDK is to show users what apps could be built with it and what the main use cases are for working with the SDK. Every person is built differently, and many people find code examples and application examples the best way to start building on their own.

Together, these components of an SDK empower developers with the knowledge, tools, and "magic" needed to build complete applications fast, securely, and with great joy!
