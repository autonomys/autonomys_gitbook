# What is a Cryptocurrency

## Features of Cryptocurrency

A cryptocurrency is a form of digital or virtual currency that is secured by [cryptography](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-cryptography) making it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology.

Here are 6 key features of cryptocurrencies:

1. Decentralized: Cryptocurrencies are not issued or controlled by any central authority like a government or bank. They operate in a decentralized manner across a peer-to-peer network.
2. Secure: Transactions in cryptocurrencies are secured through the use of cryptography, making them highly secure and difficult to counterfeit.
3. Pseudonymous: Cryptocurrency transactions are recorded in a public ledger (blockchain) without revealing the real-world identities of the parties involved. Users can hold multiple public addresses or wallets to receive and send funds.
4. Transparent: The blockchain ledger is transparent, meaning that anyone can view all transactions on the network.
5. Limited Supply: Most cryptocurrencies have a limited and predetermined supply, which is defined by code and cannot be manipulated by any central authority.
6. Global: Cryptocurrencies can be transferred globally, rapidly, and at a relatively low cost compared to traditional cross-border money transfers.

Some of the most well-known cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity due to their potential for secure, borderless, anonymous transactions and as an alternative to traditional fiat currencies.

However, their use and regulation remain a subject of ongoing debate, with concerns around price volatility, potential use in illicit activities, and environmental impact from the high energy consumption required for mining some cryptocurrencies.

Obtaining cryptocurrency can be achieved primarily through two methods: buying and mining or farming, in some contexts.

## **Are crypto coins and tokens the same?**

Crypto coins, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, are native to their own blockchain. They are designed to function as digital currency and are used to store value or make transactions.

On the other hand, crypto tokens are created on existing blockchains using the framework provided by platforms like Ethereum. Tokens can serve a variety of purposes beyond just transactions; they can represent assets, provide utility within applications, or signify ownership or rights. Tokens are versatile and can be used in applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi) services, voting systems, or as digital representations of physical assets.
