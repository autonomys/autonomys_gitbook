# What is a blockchain

Imagine you have a shared notebook that you and your friends write in to keep track of all the trades of stickers, cards, or any items you exchange. Each page of the notebook records a list of who traded what with whom, when and at what price and once the page is full, you move on to the next one. Now, to make sure no one can cheat by changing a trade recorded on any page, each new page has a special code that is created by looking at all the trades on the previous page and using a super-secret recipe (or algorithm) to generate this code. This special code is then written at the top of the next page, linking the two pages together. This way, if someone tries to change a trade on a previous page, the special code won't match anymore, and everyone will know something was altered.

This notebook is like a **blockchain**. In the blockchain world, each page of the notebook is called a "block," and the special code that links one block to the next is called a "hash." The entire list of pages, or blocks, is what forms the "chain," hence the name blockchain.

#### **Key Points of a Blockchain:**

1. **Decentralized**: Unlike a single notebook kept by one person, the blockchain is like having thousands of identical notebooks distributed across a vast network of computers. Everyone can see all the transactions, ensuring transparency and making it extremely difficult for anyone to cheat.
2. **Secure**: The special codes (hashes) that link the blocks together are created using complex mathematical puzzles. These puzzles are so hard that they require a massive amount of computing power to solve, which secures the blockchain against tampering.
3. **Immutable**: Once something is written in the blockchain, it cannot be changed or removed, making the record of transactions permanent and tamper-proof.
4. **Consensus**: For a new block to be added to the chain, the majority of the computers in the network have to agree that the transactions are valid. This agreement process is called "consensus," and it helps to further secure the system.

Blockchain technology isn't just the foundation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum; it has the potential to revolutionize various industries by providing a new way to record and verify transactions of all kinds, from financial trades to supply chain management and even voting systems. Its unique combination of transparency, security, and decentralization makes it a powerful tool for creating trust in digital interactions.
