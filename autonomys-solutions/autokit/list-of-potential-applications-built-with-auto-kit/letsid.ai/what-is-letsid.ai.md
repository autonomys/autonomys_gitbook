# What is LetsID.ai

### Introduction

[LetsID.ai](http://letsid.ai/) is a free service provided by Autonomys Labs that allows users to easily create and manage an Auto ID by connecting an existing OIDC compatible account with a verified identity, without having to manage a blockchain wallet or purchase Auto Coin.

### Inspired by Let’s Encrypt

Let's Encrypt is a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority (CA) that aims to simplify the process of obtaining and managing Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates, which are crucial for enabling secure (HTTPS) connections on the web. It was launched to make encrypted connections the default state of the internet, thereby enhancing privacy, security, and trust online. Let's Encrypt provides a software client, Certbot, among others, that automates the process of certificate issuance, installation, and renewal. By streamlining the process of securing web traffic, Let's Encrypt plays a key role in promoting a more secure and privacy-respecting internet.

By providing certificates at no charge and simplifying their management, Let's Encrypt has significantly increased the percentage of websites using HTTPS, contributing to a safer internet ecosystem where users' data is encrypted by default during transit.

Similarly, [LetsID.ai](http://letsid.ai) is focused on removing barriers and streamlining the process of obtaining and managing Auto IDs, ultimately contributing to a safer and more secure digital ecosystem for humans and AI.

### Why is this important?

1.**Enhanced Security**: By generating cryptographic key pairs locally and issuing X.509 digital certificates, [LetsID.ai](http://letsid.ai) ensures a high level of security for user identities, safeguarding against unauthorized access and identity theft.&#x20;

2.**Privacy and Autonomy**: Users maintain control over their private keys and, by extension, their digital identities. This decentralized approach reduces reliance on centralized entities, enhancing privacy.&#x20;

3.**Accessibility**: [LetsID.ai](http://letsid.ai) removes barriers to entry for secure digital identity management by eliminating the need for blockchain expertise, wallet management, or cryptocurrency transactions.&#x20;

4.**Interoperability**: Utilizing OIDC compatibility allows [LetsID.ai](http://letsid.ai) to integrate seamlessly with a wide range of existing accounts and services, facilitating broader adoption and ease of use.
