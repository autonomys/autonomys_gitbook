# Auto SDK

At this point, we’ve discussed in great detail what Auto ID is and how blockchain finally finds a real use case scenario and becomes a guardrail for AI to make sure humanity and AI can safely coexist together and collaborate effectively at scale. The question is - what would drive the adoption? How do we ensure that the idea behind AutoID is heard and understood? How do we onboard millions and billions of users? The answer to all those questions is Auto SDK.

## What is the Auto SDK?

Auto SDK ([Software Development Kit](../../additional-learning/technology-basics/general-information-about-sdk.md)) allows developers and farmers to easily interact with the Autonomys Network through familiar programming languages like Python and Javascript, without needing to understand how blockchains or smart contracts work. It exposes simple APIs for issuing and verifying Auto IDs, as well as sending and accepting payments using Auto Cash. The key point in the section above is simplicity - every user interaction with Auto ID needs to be seamless, and there should be no barriers or ambiguity in any action the user takes, it just has to work out of the box. It’s powerful and essential, but simple and transparent at the same time.

### What programming language is Auto SDK written with?

The initial implementation is written with Python - one of the most easily readable programming languages in the world. It’s fully open source and can be viewed here. The implementation of AutoID is also open source and written in one of the most secure programming languages - Rust.

Anyone who knows Python or JavaScript will be able to utilize Auto SDK to. As the Auto ecosystem evolves to encompass AutoFi and AutoCo, the SDK will expand its capabilities to support development on top of these additional platforms, enabling developers to build a wide range of applications and services within the Auto ecosystem. This is an exciting journey and we’re more than happy to consider any community contributions.
