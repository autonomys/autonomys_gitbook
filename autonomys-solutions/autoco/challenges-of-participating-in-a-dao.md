# Challenges of participating in a DAO

Participating in a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) can present several challenges:

1. Technical Complexity: DAOs operate on [blockchain technology](https://www.notion.so/What-is-a-blockchain-1161a8c9a5754a85b7d9986b1e046fa5?pvs=21) and smart contracts, which can be technically complex and difficult to understand for non-technical users. Participating in governance processes, such as voting on proposals, may require a certain level of technical knowledge.
2. Token Ownership: To participate in a DAO's governance, users typically need to hold the DAO's native cryptocurrency tokens. Acquiring and managing these tokens can be a barrier for some individuals, especially if the tokens are expensive or have limited availability.
3. Decentralized Decision-making: DAOs rely on decentralized decision-making processes, which can be slower and more complicated than traditional centralized decision-making. Reaching consensus among a large number of stakeholders with diverse interests can be challenging.
4. Governance Challenges: DAOs may face governance challenges, such as low voter participation, voter apathy, or the risk of whales (large token holders) having disproportionate influence on decision-making.
5. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape surrounding DAOs is still evolving, and there may be uncertainties around legal implications, tax considerations, and compliance requirements.
6. Security Risks: Smart contracts and blockchain systems are vulnerable to potential security risks, such as coding errors, exploits, or hacking attempts, which could compromise the DAO's funds or operations.
7. Information Asymmetry: Some DAO participants may have more information or expertise than others, leading to potential information asymmetries that could influence decision-making processes.
8. Coordination and Communication: Coordinating and communicating effectively among a decentralized network of participants can be challenging, especially when they are geographically distributed and may have different languages and cultural backgrounds.

While DAOs offer the potential for transparent and decentralized governance, participating in them requires a certain level of technical knowledge, commitment, and an understanding of the challenges involved in decentralized decision-making processes.

Many of the issues cited above would be mitigated if there were a way to participate in a DAO that was accessible, simple and fast which could be delivered to the masses. Increasing voter education and context about the issue they are voting on and how it aligns with their own values and goals will improve the quality of the decisions being made. As will providing that detail in the user’s native language. Removing as much friction and complexity as possible will also go a long way to increasing voter turn-out which improves decentralization and stakeholder engagement. Knocking down as many barriers to having your voice heard as possible will enable the next level of harnessing knowledge and opinion at scale.

The Autonomys solution to these challenges is called [Autonomys Collective](auto-collective-autoco.md) or AutoCo for short.
