# Competing Visions for Our AI Future

## Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

As we stand on the cusp of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a future filled with both promise and uncertainty beckons. AGI's imminent arrival, capable of performing any task a human can, poses profound questions about society's readiness for such transformative power. Drawing on insights from key researchers and the pivotal work ["Superintelligence" by Nick Bostrom](https://dorshon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/superintelligence-paths-dangers-strategies-by-nick-bostrom.pdf), the need for proactive, robust preparation is clear.&#x20;

The ethical quandaries of AGI development, from determining moral agency to the autonomy of AI entities, challenge us to rethink our values in this new context. Central to this ethical debate is the autonomy of both humans and AI, urging a future where AI enhances human freedom and aligns with our deepest values.

### **Autonomys and Shaping the Future of AI**

To build and align AGI effectively, utilizing platforms like Autonomys Suite is crucial for developing ethical frameworks that align AGI systems with human values. Collaborative research with leading academic institutions is essential for ethically developing AGI technologies. Moreover, incorporating **blockchain-based governance** can enhance transparency and accountability in AGI development. <mark style="color:blue;">**Autonomys**</mark> is focused on leveraging **collective intelligence for governance**, which could **crucially inform future AI systems**. This perspective suggests a need to democratize AI access, empowering global communities through open platforms and educational resources, fostering a culture of innovation and shared progress. In this vision, technology **not only amplifies human potential but also operates within a framework of decentralized governance** and equitable access, setting the stage for a society that values both human and machine autonomy.
