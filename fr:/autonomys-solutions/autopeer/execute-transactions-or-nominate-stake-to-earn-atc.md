# Execute Transactions or Nominate Stake to Earn ATC

## Active and Passive Ways to Earn From Staking ATC&#x20;

Many will get involved with the network by [becoming a farmer](farm-to-earn-atc.md) as its low barriers to entry and [Auto Peer](./) interface make it a very easy way to participate. Here we look at other ways to contribute to the network while earning ATC.

Let's investigate the innovative roles of operator and nominator within the Autonomys Network - a network powered by the Subspace protocol. An operator, in this context, is an entity or individual who runs a node responsible for validating transactions on the limitless number of individual decoupled execution environments on the network. These environments are known as [domains](https://subnomicon.subspace.network/docs/decex/overview#domains) and share the security of the consensus network [farmers](farm-to-earn-atc.md) provide. This role is pivotal, as it ensures the smooth operation and security of the blockchain, making operators key players in the network's ecosystem.

Operators earn[ ATC (Auto Coin)](../autonomys-network/an-introduction-to-autocoin-and-autocash.md) as compensation for their contributions through transaction fees. These fees are not just a reward; they serve as an incentive for operators to maintain high standards of reliability and efficiency in transaction processing. This system creates a self-sustaining ecosystem where the operators are motivated to support the network's growth and health, directly contributing to its scalability and security.

Earning ATC through transaction fees offers operators a tangible reward for their contributions. ATC, as a versatile digital currency within the Autonomys ecosystem, can be used for various purposes, including further transactions, staking, or conversion into other cryptocurrencies or fiat money. This flexibility provides operators with multiple avenues to leverage their earned ATC, aligning with their personal or organizational goals and strategies including paying for their infrastructure.

## Becoming an Operator

The process of becoming an operator involves technical setup and ongoing management of an operator node. This includes ensuring the node remains online and functions optimally to process transactions efficiently and securely. The technical requirements and operational guidelines for operators are detailed in the official documentation, providing a roadmap for interested individuals and entities to get started.

In addition to running the appropriate software on performant hardware, an operator is required to demonstrate "skin in the game" by [staking their node](https://subnomicon.subspace.network/docs/decex/domains/workflow#operator-staking). This stake is slashable which provides crypto-economic security to proceedings and disincentivizes bad or malicious actors. The staking story does not stop there though as any ATC token holder is able to get involved by nominating stake to their preferred/most trusted operator for a share of the transaction fees that operator earns. There is a symbiotic relationship between operators and nominators; increased total stake will bring increased transaction [bundle production](https://subnomicon.subspace.network/docs/decex/domains/workflow#bundle-production) and therefore more [fees](https://subnomicon.subspace.network/docs/decex/domains/workflow#domain-block-fees) as payment. They share the risk/reward between them. This relationship enhances network security and efficiency, as nominators incentivize operators to perform optimally, creating a balanced, collaborative ecosystem where both roles are vital for its health and growth.

## Summary

Running an operator node or nominating in the Autonomys ecosystem is a commitment to supporting the decoupled execution environments on a cutting-edge blockchain network. It offers the dual benefits of earning ATC through transaction fees and contributing to a decentralized, secure, and efficient blockchain infrastructure. Their roles are not just technical; they're a stake in the future of decentralized networks, with rewards that extend beyond financial gains to include participation in a community-driven technological frontier.

For those interested in becoming operators or learning more about the intricacies of earning ATC through transaction fees, the [official documentation](https://docs.subspace.network/), [the Subnomicon](https://subnomicon.subspace.network/) and our [community forums](https://forum.subspace.network/) are invaluable resources. These platforms provide comprehensive information and support, guiding prospective operators through the setup process and beyond, ensuring they are well-equipped to contribute to and benefit from the Autonomys ecosystem.
