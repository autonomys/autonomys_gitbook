# Introduction

## The Autonomys Network Protocol

The Autonomys Network is the first layer-one blockchain that can fully resolve the blockchain trilemma. \
\
It is an instance of the Subspace protocol, based on original multi-year research.

We have built the Autonomys Network from the first principles to simultaneously achieve scalability, security and decentralization. At its core, Autonomys Network implements Subspace, a novel storage-based consensus protocol that separates consensus from execution. This proposer-builder separation allows Autonomys Network to independently scale transaction throughput and storage requirements while maintaining a fully decentralized blockchain.

### Motivation

We have been drawn to the crypto space because of the opportunity it presents for a more open and inclusive future. However, the reality today is far from the dream. We set out to build the Autonomys Network to address this gap at a fundamental level and be a network able to realize Nakamoto's original vision for a more equitable and decentralized future.

Autonomys Network was designed from the ground up to achieve this vision - by:

1. Providing an energy-efficient and eco-friendly alternative to crypto mining, which still allows for mass participation by ordinary users.
2. Creating an incentive-compatible network that encourages and maintains decentralization over the long term.
3. Scaling our network's storage and compute capacity proportional to the number of node operators without sacrificing decentralization or security.
4. Connecting and enabling interoperability between existing networks to allow for the first truly unified user and developer experience across all of Web3.

We have been very intentional about solving these problems in a manner that reflects our core values. Specifically, we believe that:

* The power to control a blockchain network should be distributed amongst as many stakeholders as possible — we are unapologetic _decentralization maximalists_
* The barriers to entry should be as low as possible, allowing access to anyone who desires to participate — we believe blockchains should be _permissionless systems_
* Everyone who participates in the ecosystem should be treated equally, regardless of the resources at their disposal — the network should be _fair for all_
* The time and effort we have spent building the Autonomys Network should benefit the entire ecosystem, not just ourselves — we believe in _open-source collaboration_ and _sharing knowledge_ for the betterment of all
