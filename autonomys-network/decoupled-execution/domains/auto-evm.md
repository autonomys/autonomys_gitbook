# Auto EVM

The Auto EVM is the first execution domain launched on the Autonomys Network. As a permissionless instance of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the Auto EVM supports the deployment, management and execution of Ethereum transactions, smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) natively on the Autonomys Network.

The Auto EVM domain is seamlessly interoperable with other Autonomys domains, while maintaining the unique features of an EVM-compatible environment. By deploying on the Auto EVM, Ethereum ecosystem dApps and DeFi protocols benefit from significantly higher throughput, lower fees, and improved scalability.
