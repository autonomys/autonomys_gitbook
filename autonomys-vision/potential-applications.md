# Potential Applications

Below is an overview of several potential applications that could be built either off-chain with Auto SDK or deployed on-chain as smart control rollups.

* **Agent ID** is a framework for AI developers and service providers that allows for the identification, authentication, and authorization of autonomous AI agents acting on behalf of human users in a secure and trustworthy manner.
* **Auto PKI** is a framework for deploying unique instances of the Auto ID registry for application or industry specific use cases, such a or consortium based identity systems.
